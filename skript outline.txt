# 2 Problem Statement

## 2.1 description of dataset

## 2.2 descriptive of objectives of the report:

3. statistical methods

3.1 Simple linear regression

- assumptions:

- b0 and b1, correlation
- how to interpret b0
- how to interpret b1
- interpret log variables as regressors.
- R² value

3.2 Multiple linear regression


3.3 Best Subset Selection

- basic idea:

3.3.1 Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
- formula, when to use

3.3.2 Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
- formula, when to use

3.4 significance tests / confidence intervals for model coefficients


3.5 goodness of fit???

# 4 Results

## descriptives (with price normal and log) and age

## remove outliers:
- cooks distance

## linear regression

## compare models logprice and no logprice

good source: http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/39-regression-model-diagnostics/161-linear-regression-assumptions-and-diagnostics-in-r-essentials/

- compare R² of total models ==> logprice: 0.832, price: 0.805
- plot both models and show residuals.
- diagnostic plots: QQ Plots


explain null hypothesis for all tests.
